    title: 'Lane Detection System',
    subtitle: 'ML Implementation based on IEEE Paper',
    description: 'Implemented a lane detection model inspired by the IEEE paper HWLane: HW-Transformer for Lane Detection (2024) using a Tiny U-Net segmentation network. Applied BCE + Dice loss, cosine learning rate scheduling, SWA, and Test-Time Augmentation to improve IoU performance on TuSimple-style dataset. Achieved measurable improvement using model optimization techniques.',
